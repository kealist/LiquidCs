# Liquid in C#

This is a kind of thought experiment in porting a dataflow engine from a [homoiconic language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoiconicity) into C# which is not.  My main goal is to learn how to achieve similar power in C# without some of the amazing tools that one gets with built-in top-down recursive parsing and such.
